## **What is Grafana Cloud?**

Grafana Cloud is a monitoring platform that helps DevOps teams keep an eye on their systems and applications. It provides a centralized location where you can collect and visualize data from various sources, such as servers, databases, or applications.

## **Grafana Alerting**

Grafana Alerting allows you to learn about problems in your systems moments after they occur. Create, manage, and take action on your alerts in a single, consolidated view, and improve your teamâ€™s ability to identify and resolve issues quickly.

Grafana Alerting is available for Grafana OSS, Grafana Enterprise, or Grafana Cloud. With Mimir and Loki alert rules you can run alert expressions closer to your data and at a massive scale, all managed by the Grafana UI you are already familiar with.

## **Task: Setup alerts in Grafana**
