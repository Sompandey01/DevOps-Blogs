You will not be there 24\*7 to monitor your resources. So, Today letâ€™s monitor the resources in a smart way with - Grafana ðŸŽ‰

### What is Grafana?

Grafana is an open-source metrics and monitoring solution that allows you to collect, visualize and share your operational data in a simple and elegant way. It helps teams keep tabs on the performance and health of their applications and infrastructure.

### What are the features of Grafana?

The main features of Grafana are:

* **Dashboards -** Grafana has a powerful yet intuitive dashboard builder. You can create customizable dashboards with graphs, gauges, text panels, tables and more.
    
* **Data Sources -** Grafana supports a wide range of data sources like Prometheus, Graphite, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, etc. It can pull data from these sources and visualize it.
    
* **Graphs -** Grafana has a number of built-in graph types like time series, pie charts, single stats, heat maps, etc. You can customize graphs with thresholds, colors and more.
    
* **Templating -** Grafana supports template variables that allow you to create dynamic dashboards. Template variables can filter your data and change the UI.

4. **Templating -** Grafana's templating system allows you to create dynamic dashboards where filters, graph types, even entire panels can change based on template variables. This enhances the usability of your dashboards.
    
5. **Alerting -** Grafana's built-in alerting system allows you to configure alerts and send notifications to services like Slack, PagerDuty, etc. This helps you stay on top of any issues or anomalies in your metrics.
    
6. **Collaboration -** Dashboards in Grafana can be shared and different users can be given different levels of access. This enables collaboration within your team.
    
7. **Extensibility -** Grafana's plugin system and API allow you to extend its functionality to suit your particular use cases and integrate with other tools.
    
8. **Open source -** Grafana is open source, which means it's free to use, modify and distribute. The community is also very active.
    

### What type of monitoring can be done via Grafana?

Grafana can be used to monitor a wide variety of systems and applications, including:

â€¢ **Server monitoring -** Metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic, load averages, etc. from your servers can be visualized in Grafana. This helps you monitor the performance and health of your servers.

â€¢ **Application monitoring -** Metrics from your applications like request counts, error rates, response times, queue lengths, etc. can be pulled into Grafana. This helps you monitor the health and performance of your applications.

â€¢ **Database monitoring -** Grafana can connect to data sources for databases like Prometheus exporter for MySQL, InfluxDB for PostgreSQL, etc. This allows you to monitor database metrics like query times, connection counts, storage usage, replication lag, etc.

â€¢ **Infrastructure monitoring -** Metrics from your infrastructure components like load balancers, firewalls, switches etc. can be visualized in Grafana to help monitor the health of your overall infrastructure.

â€¢ **Cloud monitoring -** Grafana can connect to data sources for cloud platforms like AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Google Cloud Monitoring, etc. This allows you to monitor resources running in the cloud.

â€¢ **Container monitoring -** Grafana can connect to data sources like Prometheus to monitor metrics from your containerized applications running on platforms like Docker and Kubernetes.

â€¢ **Network monitoring -** Grafana can connect to data sources providing network metrics to help you monitor things like packet loss, latency, throughput on your network.

â€¢ **And more -** Grafana can also be used to monitor IoT devices, microservices, big data systems and other custom applications as long as metrics can be exported to a data source that Grafana supports.

So in short, Grafana is very flexible and can be used to monitor almost any system or application as long as metrics and logs can be exported from that system. The visualizations Grafana provides make it easier to track what's happening and identify any issues or anomalies.

### What databases work with Grafana?

Grafana can connect to and monitor metrics from a wide variety of databases, including:

â€¢ **InfluxDB -** InfluxDB is a time series database and one of the most widely used databases with Grafana. It has a Grafana data source plugin that allows you to easily connect and visualize InfluxDB metrics in Grafana.

â€¢ **Prometheus -** Prometheus is an open source monitoring system and also works very well with Grafana. It has a native data source plugin in Grafana.

â€¢ **Graphite -** Graphite is another popular open source metrics storage system. It also has a native data source plugin in Grafana.

â€¢ **Elasticsearch -** Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine. It also has a data source plugin for Grafana to visualize Elasticsearch metrics.

â€¢ **MongoDB -** MongoDB has an official Grafana data source plugin that allows you to connect to MongoDB and visualize metrics like query times, insert/update counts, storage usage, replication lag, etc.

â€¢ **MySQL -** MySQL does not have an official data source plugin but there are several community plugins that allow you to connect MySQL to Grafana and monitor metrics from MySQL.

â€¢ **PostgreSQL -** Similarly for PostgreSQL, there are community data source plugins that allow you to connect it to Grafana and monitor metrics.

â€¢ **MSSQL -** Microsoft SQL Server also has community data source plugins to integrate it with Grafana.

â€¢ **And more -** Grafana also has the ability to connect to databases like Cassandra, Redis, ClickHouse and more, either via official or community data source plugins.

### What are metrics and visualizations in Grafana?

In Grafana:

â€¢ Metrics refer to the numerical data that is collected from your systems and applications. Things like request count, error rate, response time, CPU usage, memory usage, etc. are all examples of metrics.

â€¢ Visualizations refer to the way these metrics are displayed in Grafana dashboards. Grafana has a number of built-in visualization options:

* **Graph -** The most common visualization is a time series graph that shows how a metric changes over time.
    
* **Single Stat -** Shows the current value of a metric as a single number with an optional gauge.
    
* **Table -** Displays metrics in a table format.
    
* **Gauge -** Shows a metric on a gauge or dial.
    
* **Heatmap -** Shows metrics as colors in a two-dimensional grid.
    
* **Text -** Displays text or code snippets.
    
* **And more -** Grafana also has visualizations like Pie Chart, Row Graph, Bar Gauge, etc.
    

Metrics are the numerical data collected from your systems, and visualizations are the way Grafana displays those metrics through its built-in graph types and charts, which you can fully customize to suit your needs.

### What is the difference between Grafana vs Prometheus?

Grafana and Prometheus are two complementary but different tools for monitoring and observability:

â€¢ Grafana is a metric dashboard and graph editor. It allows you to visualize metrics and logs, and create graphs and dashboards.

â€¢ Prometheus is a monitoring system and time series database. It collects and stores metrics from configured targets.

So the main differences are:

**Grafana:**

â€¢ Focuses on visualization - Grafana allows you to create graphs, dashboards, visualizations and alerts based on metrics.

â€¢ Is metric agnostic - It can connect to any data source that exposes metrics, like Prometheus, InfluxDB, Graphite, etc.

â€¢ Provides an easy to use UI for creating and editing dashboards.

**Prometheus:**

â€¢ Focuses on collection and storage of metrics

â€¢ Scrapes metrics from configured targets (e.g. servers, applications)

â€¢ Stores those scraped metrics in a time series database

â€¢ Provides an interface for querying the stored time series data

â€¢ Does not provide visualization capabilities on its own

The key takeaway is that Prometheus focuses on metrics collection and storage, while Grafana focuses on metrics visualization. They work very well together, with Prometheus acting as the data source for Grafana.
