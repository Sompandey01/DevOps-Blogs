**Prerequisites:**

Before delving into the project, let's ensure we have the necessary prerequisites in place.

1. **Create AWS Instance:**
    
    * Name: jenkins-server
        
    * AMI: ubuntu
        
    * Instance type: t2.micro (free tier)
        
    * Key pair login: Create &gt; docker.pem
        
    * Allow HTTP
        
    * Allow HTTPS
        
    
    Download the .pem file, click on Launch Instance, then connect to the EC2 instance and install the following packages.
    
2. [**Docker Installation:**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
    
3. **OpenJDK-17-JRE Installation:**
    
    ```yaml

Check ‚úÖGitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling

Put this basic Declarative pipeline code in script dialog box

```yaml
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Clone Code') {
            steps {
                echo 'Cloning the code'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'This is Build Stage'
            }
        }
        stage('Push to Docker hub') {
            steps {
                echo 'This is Test stage'
            }
        }
        stage('Deployement') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying container'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This Jenkins declarative pipeline outlines a flexible CI/CD workflow:

1. `agent any:`: Allows the pipeline to run on any available Jenkins agent.
    
2. `stages:`: Defines logical steps in the process.
    
    a. `stage('Clone Code'):`: Clones the source code repository.
    
    b. `stage('Build'):`: Builds the application, running tests and generating artifacts. c. `stage('Push to Docker Hub'):`: Pushes built artifacts to Docker Hub.
    
    d. `stage('Deployment'):`: Deploys the application or container to the target environment.
    

Each stage can include more complex logic. By automating these stages, Jenkins ensures a consistent and reproducible workflow for software CI/CD. üöÄ

* After getting success, you can see stages are green boxes with execution time.
    

## **Developing the Notes App Code: To develop the Django notes app code, follow these steps:**

1. Clone the code: In the pipeline script, add the following code to clone the code from your repository:
    

```yaml
git url: "https://github.com/Sompandey01/django-todo-cicd", branch: "master"
```

2\. Build the code: Add the following code to build the application and create docker image with tag

```yaml
sh "docker build -t notes-app ."
```

3\. Push to Docker Hub: Add the code to push the Docker image to Docker Hub:

For docker login in pipeline you have to create docker credentials and use them as environment variable

Create Credentials in Dashboard &gt; Manage jenkins &gt; Credentials &gt; System &gt; Global credentials

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1706952197952/835c80e9-59ea-4e19-9dbc-379340c6c194.png align="center")

```yaml
withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId:"dockerhub-login",passwordVariable:"dockerhubpass",usernameVariable:"dockerhubuser" )]){
    sh "docker tag notes-app ${env.dockerhubuser}/notes-app:latest"
    sh "docker login -u ${env.dockerhubuser} -p ${env.dockerhubpass}" 
    sh "docker push ${env.dockerhubuser}/notes-app:latest"
}
```

1. `withCredentials`: This is a Jenkins pipeline step provided by the "Credentials Binding Plugin." It allows you to securely retrieve and use credentials within the block. In this case, we are retrieving the Docker Hub credentials using the `usernamePassword` method.
    
2. `usernamePassword(credentialsId: "dockerhub-login", passwordVariable: "dockerhubpass", usernameVariable: "dockerhubuser")`: This line retrieves the username and password from the Jenkins credentials store. The `credentialsId` parameter specifies the unique identifier of the stored Docker Hub credentials. The `usernameVariable` and `passwordVariable` parameters define the environment variables where the username and password will be stored, respectively. The environment variables are prefixed with `env.` in Jenkins, which is why you see `env.dockerhubuser` and `env.dockerhubpass` later in the code.
    
3. `sh "docker tag notes-app ${env.dockerhubuser}/notes-app:latest"`: This line creates a new Docker image tag with the Docker Hub username as a prefix. The `notes-app` is the original local image name, and we're tagging it with the new name `${env.dockerhubuser}/notes-app:latest`. This is necessary to ensure that the image can be pushed to the Docker Hub registry with the correct repository name.
    
4. `sh "docker login -u ${env.dockerhubuser} -p ${env.dockerhubpass}"`: This line runs the `docker login` command to authenticate with Docker Hub using the username and password retrieved from the Jenkins credentials store. The `-u` flag specifies the Docker Hub username, and the `-p` flag specifies the password.
    
5. `sh "docker push ${env.dockerhubuser}/notes-app:latest"`: This line pushes the tagged Docker image to the Docker Hub registry using the `docker push` command. After authentication, the image is pushed to the repository specified by `${env.dockerhubuser}/notes-app:latest`.
    

4\. Deployment: Finally, deploy the code on the EC2 instance using the following code:

```yaml
#
sh "docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d"
```

Here is the full Declarative pipeline code for django-notes-app deployment on ec2 using docker container.

```yaml
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Clone Code') {
            steps {
                echo 'Cloning the code'
                git url: "https://github.com/SaurabhDahibhate/django_notes_app.git", branch: "master"
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'This is Build Stage'
                sh "docker build -t notes-app ."
            }
        }
        stage('Push to Docker hub') {
            steps {
                echo 'Pushing image to dockerhub'
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId:"dockerhub-login",passwordVariable:"dockerhubpass",usernameVariable:"dockerhubuser" )]){
                sh "docker tag notes-app ${env.dockerhubuser}/notes-app:latest"
                sh "docker login -u ${env.dockerhubuser} -p ${env.dockerhubpass}" 
                sh "docker push ${env.dockerhubuser}/notes-app:latest"
                }
                
            }
        }
        stage('Deployement') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying container'
                sh "docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Whenever the developer commits their code in GitHub, after every commit, it should reflect in the live web app.

¬∑ For that, we will use ‚Äúgithub webhook‚Äù.

¬∑ Every time, a developer made a commit, a trigger will run automatically, which will rebuild the image and run a container on your behalf as a part of automation that will run the pipeline automatically.

* go to on your github repository &gt; setttings &gt; Webhook &gt; Payload URL &gt; put your jenkins public ip address &gt; ‚Äúadd webhook‚Äù

* Do some changes in the code and push to GitHub, this will automatically run a pipeline, and the new code will be Live.
