## Docker Interview

Docker is a good topic to ask in DevOps Engineer Interviews, mostly for freshers. One must surely try these questions in order to be better in Docker.

## Questions **\-**

1. **Difference between Image, Container, and Engine**:
    
    * **Image**: A blueprint holding software and dependencies.
        
    * **Container**: A live instance of an image, isolated and portable.
        
    * **Engine**: Docker toolset for building, running, and managing containers.
        
2. **Difference between Docker COPY vs ADD**:
    
    * **COPY**: Straightforward file copying during image build.
        
    * **ADD**: Also supports URL fetching and auto-extraction.
        
3. **Difference between Docker CMD vs RUN**:
    
    * **RUN**: Executes commands during image build.
        
    * **CMD**: Sets the default command when a container starts.
        
4. **Reducing Docker Image Size**:
    
    * Use smaller base images like Alpine Linux.
        
    * Minimize layers, remove unused files.
        
    * Optimize Dockerfile instructions.
        
    * Clear caches in the same RUN command.
        
5. **Why and when to use Docker?**:
    
    * Docker simplifies deployment, scaling, and consistency.
        
    * It's ideal for microservices, continuous integration, and isolated environments.
        
6. **Explain Docker Components and Interaction**:
    
    * The Docker Engine includes the daemon, CLI, and REST API.
        
    * Docker images, built from Dockerfiles, are stored in the registry.
        
    * Containers are running instances of images, isolated and lightweight.
        
7. **Explain Terminology: Docker Compose, Docker File, Docker Image, Docker Container**:
    
    * **Docker Compose**: Defines multi-container setups.
        
    * **Docker File**: Script containing build instructions.
        
    * **Docker Image**: Blueprint of an application and its dependencies.
        
    * **Docker Container**: Live instance of an image, isolated.
        
8. **Real Scenarios of Using Docker**:
    
    * Setting up consistent development environments.
        
    * Deploying microservices architectures.
        
    * Enabling smooth CI/CD pipelines and efficient scaling.
        
9. **Docker vs Hypervisor**:
    
    * Docker offers lightweight OS-level virtualization.
        
    * Hypervisors provide full-fledged virtual machines.
        
10. **Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Docker**:
    
    * **Advantages**: Isolation, resource efficiency, consistency.
        
    * **Disadvantages**: Limited kernel support, security concerns.
        
11. **Docker Namespace**:
    
    * Docker uses namespaces to isolate processes within a container.
        
12. **Docker Registry**:
    
    * A registry stores and shares Docker images, like Docker Hub.
        
13. **Entry Point**:
    
    * The command that runs when a container starts.
        
14. **Implementing CI/CD in Docker**:
    
    * Utilize version-controlled Dockerfiles.
        
    * Automate image builds, testing, and deployment using CI tools.
        
    * Employ orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
        
15. **Data Loss on Container Exit**:
    
    * Data on a container's filesystem is lost without proper data persistency mechanisms like volumes.
        
16. **Docker Swarm**:
    
    * Docker Swarm is Docker's native orchestration solution for managing and scaling containers.
        
17. **Docker Commands**:
    
    * To view running containers: `docker ps`.
        
    * To run a container with a specific name: `docker run --name`.
        
    * To export a container: `docker export`.
        
    * To import an existing Docker image: `docker import`.
        
    * To delete a container: `docker rm`.
        
    * To remove stopped containers, unused networks, build caches, and dangling images: `docker system prune`.
        
18. **Common Docker Practices to Reduce Image Size**:
    
    * Opt for smaller base images (like Alpine Linux).
        
    * Minimize Dockerfile layers and remove unused files.
        
    * Clear package caches within the same RUN instruction.
