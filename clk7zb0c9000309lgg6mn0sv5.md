## Introduction:

The full form of LINUX is **Lovable Intellect Not Using XP**. It was released by Linus Torvalds on September 17, 1991. Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems that are based on the Linux Kernel. Linux is one of the most popular platforms and it is a free and open source operating system.

## Feature of Linux:

* **Open Source:** Linux code is freely available for everyone to use, modify, improve and share.
    
* **Stability:** Linux is known for its stability, handling heavy workloads without crashes or slowdowns.
    
* **Security:** It provides security in three ways namely authenticating (by assigning a password and login ID), authorization (by assigning permission to read, write and execute) and encryption (converting the file into an unreadable format).
    
* **Lightweight:** Linux is highly lightweight in comparison to another operating systems. Linux consumes less space and its installation requires around **4GB** to **8GB** of disk space. It is more beneficial to use because it's lightweight.
    

## Basics Linux Commands:

Here are some basic Linux commands:

1. **ls:** List all the directories and files.
    
2. **mkdir:** Makes a new directory.
    
3. **rmdir**: Remove a directory (only if it's empty).
    
4. **cd:** Change directory.
    
5. **cd..** : Go back to the previous directory.
    
6. pwd: Print the current working directory.
    
7. **ls -l:** List files with more details.
    
8. **cat:** Show the content of a file.
    
9. **echo:** Shows the desired string and value.
    
10. **man:** Tells about all commands.
    
11. **touch:** Create a file.
    
12. **cp:** Copy files.
    
13. **mv:** Move files.
    
14. **rm:** Remove the file permanently.
    
15. **sudo:** Administrative commands (password).
    
16. **head:** Display the first 10 lines.
    
17. **tail:** Display the last 10 lines.
    
18. **chmod:** Change file permissions.
    
19. **chown**: Change file ownership.
    
20. **history:** Shows history of command usage.
    

## Task 1: Check your present working directory

To check your current present working directory use **"pwd"** command and press enter. It will show you in which directory you're currently in.

## Conclusion:

Today, we completed the basic Linux commands like **ls, pwd** and **nested directory**. Now we are ready to use them for daily work practice and effectively explore the world of Linux.
