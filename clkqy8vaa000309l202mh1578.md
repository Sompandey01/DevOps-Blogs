### **Data Types**

* Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data.
    
* Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.
    
* Python has the following data types built-in by default: Numeric(Integer, complex, float), Sequential(string,lists, tuples), Boolean, Set, Dictionaries, etc
    

To check what is the data type of the variable used, we can simply write:

```bash
your_variable=100 
type(your_variable)
```

### **Data Structure**

In Python, data structures are like containers that help us store and manage information in a neat and efficient way. They are tools that make working with data simple and organized. Here are some common data structures in Python:

1. **Lists:** Lists are like ordered shopping bags that can hold different things together. You can add, remove, or change items in the bag.
    
2. **Tuples:** Tuples are similar to lists but more like sealed packages. Once you put things inside, you can't change them.
    
3. **Dictionaries:** Dictionaries work like phone books, where you find names (keys) and their corresponding numbers (values). It helps you quickly find what you need.
    
4. **Sets:** Sets are like collections of unique items, just like a group of friends without any duplicates.
    
5. **Strings:** Strings are like sentences made up of letters. They help us work with text and words.
    
6. **Arrays:** Arrays are specialized tools to work with numbers efficiently. They are helpful for advanced math and calculations.
    

## Task 1: Give the Difference between List, Tuple and Set.

**1\. List:**

* Lists are ordered collections of elements.
    
* They are mutable, which means you can add, remove, or modify elements.
    
* Lists are defined using square brackets `[]`.
    
* Elements in a list can be duplicates.
    

```bash
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]
```

**2\. Tuple:**

* Tuples are ordered collections of elements, just like lists.
    
* However, tuples are immutable, meaning once created, their elements cannot be changed.
    
* Tuples are defined using parentheses `()`.
    
* Elements in a tuple can be duplicates.
    

```bash
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4)
```

1. Set:
    

* A set is an unordered collection of unique elements enclosed in curly braces `{}` or created using the `set()` function.
    
* Sets are mutable, so you can add or remove elements after creating them.
    
* Sets do not allow duplicate elements. If you try to add a duplicate element, it will be automatically removed.
    
* Sets are typically used when you need to perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
    

```bash
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

### **Task 2: Create the below Dictionary and use Dictionary methods to print your favourite tool just by using the keys of the Dictionary.**

```bash
# Create the fav_tools dictionary
fav_tools = {1: "Linux", 2: "Git", 3: "Docker", 4: "Kubernetes", 5: "Terraform", 6: "Ansible", 7: "Chef"}

# Your favorite tool's key (assuming you like "Docker" in this example)
your_favorite_tool_key = 3

# Print your favorite tool using the dictionary method
favorite_tool = fav_tools[your_favorite_tool_key]
print("Your favorite tool is:", favorite_tool)
```
