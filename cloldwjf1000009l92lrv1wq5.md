## What are Modules?

Modules are containers for multiple resources that are used together. A module consists of a collection of .tf and/or .tf.json files kept together in a directory

A module can call other modules, which lets you include the child moduleâ€™s resources into the configuration in a concise way.

Modules can also be called multiple times, either within the same configuration or in separate configurations, allowing resource configurations to be packaged and re-used.

### Below is the format on how to use modules:

```yaml
# Creating a AWS EC2 Instance
resource "aws_instance" "server-instance" {
  # Define number of instance
  instance_count = var.number_of_instances

  # Instance Configuration
  ami                    = var.ami
  instance_type          = var.instance_type
  subnet_id              = var.subnet_id
  vpc_security_group_ids = var.security_group

  # Instance Tagsid
  tags = {
    Name = "${var.instance_name}"
  }
}
```

```yaml
# Server Module Variables
variable "number_of_instances" {
  description = "Number of Instances to Create"
  type        = number
  default     = 1
}

variable "instance_name" {
  description = "Instance Name"
}

variable "ami" {
  description = "AMI ID"
  default     = "ami-xxxx"
}

variable "instance_type" {
  description = "Instance Type"
}

variable "subnet_id" {
  description = "Subnet ID"
}

variable "security_group" {
  description = "Security Group"
  type        = list(any)
}
```

```yaml
# Server Module Output
output "server_id" {
  description = "Server ID"
  value       = aws_instance.server-instance.id
}
```

## Different modules in Terraform?

There are three main types of modules in Terraform:

1. **Root Module** - This is the main directory of your Terraform configuration. It contains the `.tf` files that define the root resources.
    
2. **Child Module** - Any module that is called from another module is a child module. Child modules can be defined locally or downloaded from a registry.
    
3. **Published Module** - These are modules that have been published to a registry for reuse. Terraform has a public registry that hosts thousands of free modules.
    

## Difference between Root Module and Child Module?

Every Terraform configuration has at least one module, known as the root module. This consists of the `.tf` files in the main working directory. The root module contains resources that define the root-level infrastructure. A child module is a module that is called from another module. It contains resources that are encapsulated and reusable.

## Is modules and Namespaces are same? Justify your answer for both Yes/No

Modules and namespaces are not the same - they have important differences in how they organize code and scope variables. Modules provide true isolation and modularity, while namespaces are used for logical grouping.
