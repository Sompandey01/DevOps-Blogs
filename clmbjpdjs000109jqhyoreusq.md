Hi, I hope you had a great day yesterday. Today as part of the #90DaysofDevOps Challenge we will be exploring most commonly used service in AWS i.e S3.

## What is AWS S3?

AWS S3 stands for Amazon Simple Storage Service. It is Amazon's cloud storage service for storing and retrieving any amount of data from the cloud.

**Some key points about AWS S3:**

* It is a simple object storage service, which means you store files as objects with a unique URL.
    
* It provides 11 9's of durability, meaning your data is extremely durable and unlikely to be lost.
    
* It offers high availability and scalability. It can scale to exabytes of data and to millions of requests per second.
    
* Data is stored across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.
    

**Some common use cases for S3 are:**

* Storing static websites
    
* Serving images/videos/files to applications
    
* Storing backups and archives
    
* Collecting logs from AWS services
    

## Task 1: AWS EC2 and S3 Interaction

* **Launch an EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console and connect to it using Secure Shell (SSH).**
    

1. **Log in to AWS Console:** Go to the AWS Management Console and log in to your AWS account.
    
2. **Launch an EC2 Instance:**
    
    * Navigate to the EC2 service.
        
    * Click on "Instances" in the left sidebar.
        
    * Click the "Launch Instances" button to create a new EC2 instance.
        
    * Follow the instance creation wizard, selecting an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), configuring instance details, adding storage, configuring security groups (allow SSH traffic), and reviewing your settings.
        
    * Launch the instance and create or select an existing key pair to use for SSH access.
        
3. **Connect to the EC2 Instance:**
    
    * Once your EC2 instance is running, select it in the EC2 dashboard.
        
    * Click the "Connect" button to view instructions for connecting via SSH. Use the provided SSH command, replacing `your-key.pem` with the path to your private key file.
        
    * **For example:**
        
        ```bash
        ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@ec2-instance-public-ip
        ```
        

* **Create an S3 bucket and upload a file to it using the AWS Management Console.**
    
* Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console and Click the "Create bucket" button.

* Choose a unique bucket name, select a region, and configure any additional settings as needed.

* Create the bucket.

* The S3 bucket is created now.

**Upload a File to the S3 Bucket:**

* Inside your newly created S3 bucket, click the "Upload" button.
    
* Select the file you want to upload from your local machine and follow the upload wizard.

* The file is now uploaded to the S3 bucket.

* **Access the file from the EC2 instance using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).**
    

**Install AWS CLI on EC2:**

* If it's not already installed on your EC2 instance, you can install the AWS CLI by running:
    

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install awscli -y
```

Once you installed AWS CLI use `aws --version` to check AWS CLI version.

Now, configure your aws by using `aws configure` command and enter your AWS access key id and Secret access key.

Now, list s3 bucket using `aws s3 ls` command:

If you want to download the files present in your s3 bucket for that you can use `aws s3 cp` command to download the files.
