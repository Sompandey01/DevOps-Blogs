One of the most important parts of your DevOps and CICD journey is a Declarative Pipeline Syntax of Jenkins

## Some terms for your Knowledge

**What is Pipeline -** A pipeline is a collection of steps or jobs interlinked in a sequence.

**Declarative:** Declarative is a more recent and advanced implementation of a pipeline as a code.

**Scripted:** Scripted was the first and most traditional implementation of the pipeline as a code in Jenkins. It was designed as a general-purpose DSL (Domain Specific Language) built with Groovy.

## Why you should have a Pipeline

The definition of a Jenkins Pipeline is written into a text file (called a [`Jenkinsfile`](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile)) which in turn can be committed to a projectâ€™s source control repository.  
This is the foundation of "Pipeline-as-code"; treating the CD pipeline as a part of the application to be versioned and reviewed like any other code.

**Creating a** `Jenkinsfile` and committing it to source control provides a number of immediate benefits:

* Automatically creates a Pipeline build process for all branches and pull requests.
    
* Code review/iteration on the Pipeline (along with the remaining source code).
    

## Pipeline syntax

```python
pipeline {
    agent any 
    stages {
        stage('Build') { 
            steps {
                // 
            }
        }
        stage('Test') { 
            steps {
                // 
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') { 
            steps {
                // 
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Task-01: **Jenkins "Hello World" Declarative Pipeline**

* Create a New Job, this time select Pipeline instead of Freestyle Project.
    

1. Click on "New Item" to create a new Jenkins job.
    
2. **Enter Job Details:**
    
    * Provide a name for the job (e.g., "HelloWorldPipeline").
        
    * Choose "Pipeline" as the job type.

**Configure Pipeline:** In the pipeline configuration section:

* Choose "Pipeline script" from the "Definition" drop-down.
    
* In the "Pipeline" section, you can directly enter the Declarative pipeline script.

**Add Declarative Pipeline Script:** Use the following example as your Declarative pipeline script:

```python
 pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World!'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Save and Run:**

* Click on "Save" to save your pipeline configuration.
    
* Run the pipeline job by clicking on "Build Now."

**View Console Output:** After the build completes, you can click on the build number to view the console output. You'll see the output "Hello World!" printed as part of the pipeline execution.
